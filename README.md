Create a script to assemble assets for Resource Containers (Sponsor: Joe S)
NEED: Resource Containers need to be created on the fly building on the assets available in the Source Audio Server and WACS repos
DESCRIPTION: It is not practical to anticipate and store all the possible combination of source materials in resource containers that could be desired by users of Orature.  Instead an app should poll the repos and source audio server to offer what is available for a given GL language and create the resource container on the fly.  Then this app should bundle and deliver it to the user.
